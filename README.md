As an extension of a hackday project at ST, Triposal provides travelers with interactive suggestions of where to stay based off desired activities, dates, weather and budget. I built out a fully dynamic API via scraping data from Expedia, WeatherUnderground, and Google Maps. The results displayed on the map link to a custom EAN white-label hotel booking service.

I utilized Bootstrap along with PHP, MySQL and JS for development.
